## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
In order to detect bottlenecks with existing triple stores that form the backbone of many Linked Data-based applications,
the Mighty Storage Challenge is being organized.
<!-- Need         -->
One task in this challenge concerns the storage and querying of versioned datasets.
<!-- Task         -->
We aim to participate by combining the OSTRICH triple store and the Comunica SPARQL engine.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article, we briefly introduce our system as an entry for the versioning task of this challenge.
<!-- Findings     -->
We present preliminary results that show that our system achieves fast query times for the supported queries,
other queries are not supported by Comunica at the time of writing.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These results of this challenge will serve as a guideline for further improvements to our system.
<!-- Perspectives -->
