## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
In order to exploit the value of historical information in Linked Datasets,
we need to be able to store and query different versions of such datasets efficiently.
The Mighty Storage Challenge is being organized to discover the efficiency of such Linked Data stores and to detect their bottlenecks.
<!-- Need         -->
One task in this challenge focusses on the storage and querying of versioned datasets,
<!-- Task         -->
in which we aim to participate by combining the OSTRICH triple store and the Comunica SPARQL engine.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article, we briefly introduce our system as an entry for the versioning task of this challenge.
<!-- Findings     -->
We present preliminary results that show that our system achieves fast query times for the supported queries,
other queries are not supported by Comunica at the time of writing.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These results of this challenge will serve as a guideline for further improvements to our system.
<!-- Perspectives -->
